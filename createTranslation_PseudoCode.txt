Takes in string type song and sets string type translation to it
Interger translationLength keeps track of how long the translation should be
Repeatedly:
	check if char in song[c] is one of the colors
		check what color song[c] is and assign the char of that color to the variable "color"
		if the color has a digit after it, change var color to be uppercased
			check for second digit
			digit amount assigned to numBeat
			assign the uppercase color char to translate numBeat amount of times
			increase translationLength by numBeat
			increase c by numBeat + 1
		if the color has no digit after it, assign song[c] to the char color and
			increase both transLength and c by 1
	if char in song[c] is not color, set translate[c] equal to x (a pause)
	increase c by 1
Erase all /'s that remained in translation
Return translation
